Hi, I’m <strong>Iqbal Okthapian</strong> — a Web Developer & Problem Solver. I build fast, well-structured, SEO-friendly, and scalable websites, from landing pages to WordPress-based systems and custom PHP applications. My goal is simple: create digital products that are reliable, efficient, and ready to grow with your business.
</p>

<p>
I believe development is not just about writing code, but about solving real business problems. Every project I build is designed with performance, security, and long-term maintainability in mind, so your website works well today and remains strong in the future.
</p>

<p><strong>What I focus on:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Solution-oriented development</strong> — every feature is built with a clear business purpose.</li>
  <li><strong>Custom development</strong> — lightweight, flexible solutions tailored to real needs.</li>
  <li><strong>Performance & SEO</strong> — clean structure, fast loading, and search-engine ready.</li>
  <li><strong>Security by design</strong> — safe, stable systems built from day one.</li>
  <li><strong>Clear communication</strong> — transparent progress and easy collaboration.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I specialize in custom WordPress themes and plugins built with manual coding, as well as native PHP and modern framework-based applications. This approach allows me to deliver secure, high-performance, and scalable systems that are easy to maintain and ready to support long-term growth.
</p>

<p>
Beyond client projects, I actively work on open-source and daily coding experiments that reflect how I structure systems and solve problems in real-world scenarios. If you’re looking for a developer who values quality, clarity, and practical solutions, I’d be happy to help turn your ideas into a real product.
